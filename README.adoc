= Othello Implementations

This repository is more of a benchmark of how various languages perform
when dealing with the zero-sum game of Othello. It's also to showcase
any improvements between the versions, and at the end of the day, I
enjoy implementing this game (I blame one of my college professors for the
original assignment). I also see this a fun/decent way of learning new languages.

Each sub-directory will contain an implementation of the game in that
specific language. For example, the Rust version will be in the subdir called
`rust`, and so on. A README will be provided to document which algorithm(s)
is/are implemented, and if it is multithreaded.

Also, it's to keep from having more than 5 repos that are all effectively the
same project re-implemented in different languages.
